# Advancing Named Entity Recognition in Interprofessional Collaboration and Education

This repository implements a novel framework that integrates Named Entity Recognition (NER) with dynamic multi-agent modeling to support effective **Interprofessional Collaboration (IPC)** and education. It combines a **Synergistic Collaboration Framework (SCF)** and an **Adaptive Synergy Optimization Strategy (ASOS)** to improve domain-specific communication, knowledge exchange, and interdisciplinary synergy.

## 🧠 Overview

Traditional NER systems struggle to adapt to the highly dynamic and context-dependent nature of interprofessional settings. To address these limitations, this project proposes:

- **SCF**: A dynamic agent-based system where professional roles (e.g., doctors, nurses, pharmacists) are modeled as intelligent agents interacting via a weighted graph structure.
- **ASOS**: A strategy layer that optimizes interaction by resolving conflicts, reallocating resources, and applying real-time feedback.

## 🔧 Features

- Fine-tuned transformer-based NER models.
- Modular agent interaction and graph modeling.
- Real-time synergy evaluation and optimization.
- Configurable preprocessing and data pipelines.
- Basic testing framework using `pytest`.

## 🔮 Future Development

We aim to extend **SyNERgy** in the following directions:

- **Domain Adaptation**: Extend NER capabilities to other interprofessional contexts such as legal, education, or engineering domains through transfer learning and prompt tuning.
- **Real-Time Interaction**: Enable dynamic integration with communication platforms (e.g., chat systems, EHRs) for live entity tagging and conflict resolution.
- **Explainability and Audit Trails**: Introduce explainable AI components and logging for transparency in agent decisions and optimization strategies.
- **Knowledge Graph Integration**: Fuse entity outputs into domain-specific knowledge graphs to enhance contextual reasoning and long-term collaboration analytics.
- **Human-in-the-Loop Feedback**: Incorporate expert review loops for continuous learning and contextual refinement in evolving professional environments.

We welcome contributions and collaborations to bring these goals to life.
